{'products': [{'productName': 'AQUACER® 531', 'description': '\nAQUACER® 531 by BYK is a non-ionic emulsion of modified polyethylene wax containing water as a carrier. It acts as an anti-caking additive for thermoplastics. It is used in the underwater pelletizing of granulated thermoplastic (TPE, TPU, EVA) and forms a protective layer covering it, thereby generating non-sticking and free-flowing granulated materials. It is required in significantly low quantities which avoid an impact on the properties of the thermoplastic material and generation of dust during processing is also eliminated. AQUACER® 531 complies with REACH, EINECS, TSCA, DSL, AICS, PICCS, IECSC, ENCS, NZIoC and ECSI. It is listed with Directive 2011/65/EU (EU RoHS 2), Directive (EU) 2015/863 (EU RoHS 3), EU Directive 2002/96/EC (WEEE), EU Directive 94/62/EC (Packaging Waste) and CONEG Toxics in Packaging. Recommended dosage level is 0.2-5% additive in the circuit water. It has a shelf life of 15 months.\n'}], 'attributes': {None: 'Test Condition', 'Solid Content': None, 'Melting Point': None, 'Viscosity': None}}
