{'products': [{'productName': 'BYK-MAX HS 4301', 'description': '\nBYK-MAX HS 4301 by BYK is a granulated, VOC-free, long-term thermal stabilizer for use in polypropylene compounds. It consists of a combination of thermal stabilizers. The thermal stabilizers inhibit thermo-oxidative decomposition by intercepting radicals and decomposing reactive peroxides. It also has a very positive influence on long-term heat aging (LTHA), which makes it possible to achieve the automotive standard specifications more easily. Depending on the glass fiber content, adding approx. 2% of the additive can achieve a long-term heat aging duration of 1200 hours at 150Â°C. It is recommended for long fiber-reinforced pellets for automotive parts, underbody paneling, screens and structural components. The recommended level is 2% additive (as supplied) based upon the total formulation for 20-30% glass fiber content and 2.6% additive (as supplied) based upon the total formulation for 40% glass fiber content. It is added via volumetric or gravimetric dosing units during processing in all extruders and injection molding machines. The shelf life of BYK-MAX HS 4301 is 12 months.\n'}], 'attributes': {None: 'Test Condition', 'Bulk Density': None, 'Active Content': None, 'Processing Temperature': None}}
