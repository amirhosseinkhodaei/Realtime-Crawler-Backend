{'products': [{'productName': 'BYK-MAX LS 4125', 'description': '\nBYK-MAX LS 4125 by BYK is a safe, easy to handle, VOC-free, dust-free, granulated UV stabilizer for the use in polyolefins to improve the long-term UV stability with low blooming. It offers outstanding UV stability for thick-film PP and PE products and for products with proportionally large surfaces such as films, fibers, and tapes. The synergistic blend of highly concentrated HALS not only inhibits the light-induced decomposition of the material, but also acts as a radical scavenger, peroxide decomposer, and reaction inhibitor. It possesses long-lasting UV protection. The recommended level is 0.5-2.0% additive (as supplied) based upon the total formulation. It can be added via volumetric or gravimetric dosing units during processing in tape/film extruders, spinning plants, and injection molding machines. BYK-MAX LS 4125 is recommended for bumpers, vehicle interior & exterior parts, profiles, ropes, carpets, non-woven materials, injection-molded items for outside applications, e.g. garden furniture. The shelf life of this product is 12 months.\n'}], 'attributes': {None: 'Test Condition', 'Bulk Density': None, 'Active Content': None, 'Melting Point': None}}
